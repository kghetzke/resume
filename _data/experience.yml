This project included the development of Forecaster and ForecastResults objects allowing our team to easily update models as new data comes in, store results in Snowflake, and reinitialize results objects back into a Python environment from those Snowflake tables.</li><li>Developed a new, syndicated survey product from the ground up. To support this project I collaborated with Sales and Research to write a compelling questionnaire; then individually developed Python code to automate survey operations steps, including writing a script which reads new survey parameters from a form and returns the XML code for a fully programmed survey. Afterwards, I built an automated process to ingest survey data via APIs and return a lightweight HTML file that included interactive visualizations and could be hosted in the "reports" section of our platform.</li></ul>
